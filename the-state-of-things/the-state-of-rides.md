# The state of rides

## Long morning rides

1. -50% basal 1.5h before
2. -20% basal immediately after, fo 4h
3. 2.5 u for 60g breakfast
4. -1u, .5 correction for meal after

- had to eat extra on ride. back to 2u breakfast

## Lunch rides from Vigorate

This is a short ride, so:

1. -50% basal for 1h (the duration of the ride), 1.5h before
2. No bolus adjustments after
3. No basal reduction after - -20% allowed BG to rise too much.

- -50% basal, 1.5h before, for 1 hour only
- Lunch immediately after the ride (around 1:30). No adjustment
- watch out for a hypo when riding home (around 5). Eat a snack at 4:00 no matter what BG is doing.

**Looks like this works, folks!**

**Try -20% basal for 4h immediately after 1h of 50% - try and outwit the late afternoon hypo**
