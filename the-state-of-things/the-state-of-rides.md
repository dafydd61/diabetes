# The state of rides

## Lunch rides from Vigorate

This is a short ride, so not a lot of reduction after.

- -50% basal, 1.5h before, until end of ride
- -20% basal at end of ride, for 4 hours
- Lunch immediately after the ride (around 1:30). -1u bolus
- watch out for a hypo when riding home (around 5). Eat a snack at 4:30 no matter what BG is doing.
