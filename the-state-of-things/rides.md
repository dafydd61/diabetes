# Rides

## 2015-11-20 - Vigorate lunchtime

BG's been really high recently. Just switched to a baseline that's about 20% higher then previously, so playing it safe.

- -50% basal 1.5h before
- return to -20% at end of ride, keep for 4h
- 8.7 before ride
- -1u bolus for lunch
- 2.5 hours after lunch BG is 11.4 - .6u correction bolus
- tempted to skip snack before ride home - I'm at 11.9 at 4:15 and not moving - but I'm having it anyway, for safety.
