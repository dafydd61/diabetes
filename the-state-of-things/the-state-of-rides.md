# The state of rides

## Lunch rides from Vigorate

This is a short ride, so:

1. Not a lot of reduction after.
2. -1u for lunch bolus
3. No basal reduction after - -20% allowed BG to rise too much.

- -50% basal, 1.5h before, for 1 hour only
- Lunch immediately after the ride (around 1:30). No adjustment
- watch out for a hypo when riding home (around 5). Eat a snack at 4:00 no matter what BG is doing.

**Looks like this works, folks!**
